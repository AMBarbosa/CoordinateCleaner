# Version 2.0-20

Fixing a warning resulting from unbalanced code chunk delimiters in one of the vignettes in the previous version (2.0-18) on CRAN. 

Additionally, change of maintainer email due to a change in institution.

The NOTE on spelling errors in the DESCRIPTION is spurious in my opinion, since it flags my last name and Latin abbreviation "et al"" from the literature reference.

The package has been removed from CRAN due to slow response time. Response time was slow because I am on parental leave.
