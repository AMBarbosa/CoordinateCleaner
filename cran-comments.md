# Version 2.0-5
An update to fix some minor bugs, including vignettes with duplicated index entries and an update of the maintainer email. 

Reply to the last round of review (v2.0-4)
Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs: http://opengeocode.org/download/cow.php
- This was the reference to one of the data sources, which was apparently unstable. We replaced it by a hopefully more reliable one (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/).

Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?
- A scientific manuscript describing the method is currently in press, and we will add the citation with DOI as soon as we have it.
