# Version 2.0-5
A update to fix some minor bugs, including vignettes with duplicated index entries and an update of the maintainer email. We replaced the broken url (http://opengeocode.org/download/cow.php) which was the reference to one of the data sources by a more another one (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/, unlikely to break...). A scientific manuscript discribing the method is currently in press, and we will add the citation with DOI as soon as we have it.
