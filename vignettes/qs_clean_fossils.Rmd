`CoordinateCleaner` includes a set of functions suited for fossil records including tests for imprecise or erroneous dating. `clean_fossils` is a wrapper including relevant spatial and temporal tests. As all test the temporal tests can be called individually, using the `cf_equal`, `cf_range` and `cf_outl` functions.

***Please find a detailed tutorial on how to clean occurrence records (e.g. from GBIF) [here](https://azizka.github.io/CoordinateCleaner/articles/Cleaning_GBIF_data_with_CoordinateCleaner.html) and how to clean fossil data (e.g. from PBDB) [here](https://azizka.github.io/CoordinateCleaner/articles/Cleaning_PBDB_fossils_with_CoordinateCleaner.html).***

```{r, collapse = T, tidy = T}
library(CoordinateCleaner)

# Simulate example data
minages <- runif(250, 0, 65)
exmpl <- data.frame(accepted_name = sample(letters, size = 250, replace = TRUE),
                    lng = runif(250, min = 42, max = 51),
                    lat = runif(250, min = -26, max = -11),
                    min_ma = minages,
                    max_ma = minages + runif(250, 0.1, 65))

# Run fossil test
test <- clean_fossils(x = exmpl)

summary(test)
